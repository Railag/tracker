University Education in Belarus
Education is among the national priorities in the Republic of Belarus. The system of education is based on national traditions and global trends in education area. The Belarusian universities train highly qualified professionals for the national economy. There are 2 types of universities in Belarus: classical universities, which are oriented to basic science and humanities and branch universities which cover the programs for industry, economy, medicine, arts and etc. Currently, there are 58 universities in Belarus, both public and private. Among the leading universities are the Belarusian State University, the Belarusian State University of Economics, the Belarusian National Technical University, the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics and others. Their principal objective is to improve the quality of education, to enhance professional mobility and competitiveness of their graduates at the labor market.
Public higher education system provides over 300 professional qualifications in all fields. Universities are centers of research as well as teaching and many postgraduates are engaged in research for higher degrees, usually Masterâ€™s Degree and PhD. Participation of students in research is considered as a key pillar of their training and the interest in research work has increased in recent years. Many students participate in the nation-wide contest of students research works. To develop this activity the Presidential Special Fund for Support of Advanced Students was established a few years ago. The Fund annually offers 100 grants.
The researchers of the Belarusian Universities have achieved some significant results in many fields. For example, the research in micro- and nanoelectronics done by the Belarusian University of Informatics and Radioelectronics has received the National Award in Science and Technology.
In the context of knowledge- and science-intensive economy there is a huge demand for IT-specialists. Our university is well capable to respond to this challenge and offers good opportunities to build up skills in different areas starting from radioengineering and computer design to artificial intelligence. Our graduates are in demand both at the national and international labour markets because the Belarusian higher education system is striving to avoid narrow focus and teaches students to use their knowledge and skills in wider areas.
However, despite all strengths of the Belarusian tertiary education, there are weaknesses as well. One of the major problems is, unfortunately, lack of proper funding and, as a result, inadequate and insufficient availability of laboratory equipment and technologies. The second problem is overemphasis on subjects which are not fully relevant to the chosen specialty.
A new impetus should be given to postgraduate education system to make it more effective and attractive. Particularly, the problem could be solved through intensification of international scientific co-operation and academic mobility. Another action is a special financial support of young scientists research projects through the system of the state grants as well as offering better opportunities to publicize the results.
